## 🚀 Workflow Overview
### **1. Data Processing & Feature Engineering**
- Handling missing values
- Scaling numerical features
- Encoding categorical features
- Creating advanced engineered features:
- `Loan_to_Income`
- `Employment_Stability`
- `CreditLines_per_Year`
- `High_Risk_Loan`


All transformations are built into the **FeatureEngineer** class and integrated inside the saved pipeline.


---


## 🤖 Modeling
Trained classification models:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- Naive Bayes
- Decision Tree


Evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, F1-score
- ROC-AUC
- Sensitivity & Specificity


🏆 **Logistic Regression** delivered the best ROC-AUC and was saved as the final inference pipeline.


---


## 📦 Pipeline Deployment
The file `best_model_Logistic_Regression.joblib` contains a full pipeline:
- Feature engineering
- Preprocessing (imputation, scaling, encoding)
- Final trained model


➡️ **You can run predictions directly on raw input data. No manual preprocessing required.**


---


## ▶️ Running Predictions
Execute:
```
python pipeline_test.py
```
This script:
- Loads the saved pipeline
- Passes a test sample
- Returns prediction + probability
